NAME
    perl-posterous - Perl Posterous API Library

DESCRIPTION
    A Perl library for accessing the Posterous API. Initial conception
    because I wanted a way to make sure that I could backup all of the data
    that I would be putting into the system if I started using Posterous for
    blogging.
